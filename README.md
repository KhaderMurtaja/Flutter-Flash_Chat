# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Goal

The objective of this app is to incorporate Firebase into Flutter apps. I'm using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.


## What I have created

I've built a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
